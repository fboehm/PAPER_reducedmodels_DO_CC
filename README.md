# PAPER\_reducedmodels\_DO\_CC

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PAPER\_reducedmodels\_DO\_CC is to illustrate use of reduced
models in two multiparental crosses.

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.
